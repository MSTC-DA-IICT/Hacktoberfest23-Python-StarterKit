MSTC, DA-IICT presents this initiative to promote open-source contributions during Hacktoberfest 2023. Our goal is to make the most out of this year's Hacktoberfest by encouraging developers to contribute to projects that benefit the community. This repository actively participates in Hacktoberfest 2023, and all successful pull requests(PR) made here will be counted among the at least 4 successful pull requests to qualify for Hacktoberfest appreciation (planting a tree / get a tee).

Feel free to contribute and bring new energy to this project!
